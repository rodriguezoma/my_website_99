title: "Tempus"
description: "During collaboration with a colleague on a project, you may find cases where Git is highlighting differences
on seemingly unchanged sentences.
If that is the case, check whether your partner is using a different operating system to you.
The "culprit" is the fact that Git evaluates an invisible character at the end of every line. This is how Git tracks
changes."
