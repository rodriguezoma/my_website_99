description: "GitHub acts as the central node in a distributed network,
something especially valuable when you are collaborating on a
project with others
If you would like to move an existing project to GitHub, create
an empty repo there first, clone it locally, and then copy all
your files across.
Github + RStudio Projects is a natural and great way to roganise
your work. They also solve absolute vs. relative path problems,
since the .Rproj file acts as an anchor point for all other files in
the repo and you never have to manually set your working
directory."
